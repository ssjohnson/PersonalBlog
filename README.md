###To Mongo Or Not To Mongo, This Is The Question

I should probably figure out authentication first. It shouldn't be too difficult, granted I am sitting next to "Impractical Jokers" blasting out of a soundbar && A and K speaking loudly across from me (as always). Business as usual around here.

So: 2 Options here:
MongoDB - Use mongoose and passport to authenticate.
MySQL - Figure out how to authenticate using MySQL and res.connection. I will probably do this.
